          Hi I'm Joash Laurent, welcome to my digital playground, where every
          line of code tells a story! I'm Joash Laurent, a Front-End Developer.
          With a year of immersive experience, I'm not just stopping at crafting
          seamless user interfaces; I'm diving into the realms of back-end
          wizardry and data alchemy. My next venture? Mastering C++ to build
          robust, versatile solutions.
        </p>
